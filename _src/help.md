We need volunteers, extras, locations, and donations.

It’s not always obvious, but movies are made by tons of people—communities of hard-working, committed individuals who really believe in the project, in what it stands for and what the final outcome will be. We’re making <cite>Happy Baby</cite> with this sort of mentality in mind. We want to make something from our hearts, and your hearts, too. 

For inquiries, or to express interest in donating or volunteering, please contact Rebecca Rubenstein at [rubenstein@therumpus.net](mailto:rubenstein@therumpus.net).


Food
----

Here are a few ways you can help feed our cast and crew:

1. ### Cook meals:
	
	We’re looking for volunteers interested in cooking meals for about 30 people, give or take. We’re not necessarily looking for someone who would do this full-time (although we’d love you if you could), but even one donated, homecooked meal would make a huge difference.

2. ### Donate a meal:
	
	If you can’t bring a meal to set, but would still like to help out in this capacity, we’re taking monetary donations so we can feed everyone and support local eateries. If you’d like to sponsor a meal, you can do it for $400.

3. ### Donate food from your own restaurant, café, or food truck:
	
	If you’re reading this, and you either work in or own an eating establishment (stationary or mobile), and you’d like to help a low-budget indie feature out, we’d love to talk to you. [Please contact us!](mailto:rubenstein@therumpus.net)

Interested in donating? [Hit us up.](mailto:rubenstein@therumpus.net) (We are also looking for a few hard-working [volunteers](/volunteer/) to help man the craft services table, make coffee runs, and do all sorts of food-related stuff.)


Locations
---------

We’re almost there, but we’re still looking for a few places to shoot. If you have access to or own any of the following spaces, and would be interested in letting us use them, please [let us know](mailto:rubenstein@therumpus.net). You could also volunteer to pay rent for a location.

What we need:


* ### Maria's Apartment:
	
	Comfortable, one bedroom apartment. 
* ### Theo's Work:
	
	Office and filing room.
* ### Youngest Theo's home:
	
	An apartment or house where Theo lives with his parents in 1995. Includes a shot in the living room with his sick mother watching television. Bathroom. Bedroom. And kitchen. We should be able to shoot this out in one day.
* ### Movie Theater:
	
	That's right, we said it. There is a scene set in a movie theater.
* ### Marco's Work:
	
	Open-back construction truck.



Other Needs
-----------

We need cars and drivers to move crews and equipment. If you're not available to drive but have a car we can use, [let's talk](mailto:rubenstein@therumpus.net). We also need a truck, a passenger van, and secured overnight parking.

We also have to fly some people here, so if you have airline miles you're willing to donate, that would be amazing. You don't have to donate a full ticket. Maybe you've just got a thousand miles laying around you know you're never going to use because you don't even like that airline. We can take those off your hands. That would save us big time.
