Have you ever wanted to be in a movie? We’re looking for people with some time on their hands to help fill our scenes. We're looking for all ages and all races (one of our scenes takes place in a full movie theater). There are also the standard diner scenes, etc.

For our most extensive, extra-heavy scene, we’re looking for young African-American and Latino males, preferably over 18, who can pass for 13-18. We are also looking for a few Caucasian males who can play in this age range.

If you’re interested, please contact April Xiong at [april.xiong@gmail.com](mailto:april.xiong@gmail.com).
