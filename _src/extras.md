Have you ever wanted to be in a movie? We’re looking for people with some time on their hands to help fill our scenes. We're looking for all ages and all races. There are also the standard diner scenes, etc.

For our most extensive, extra-heavy scene, we’re looking for young African-American and Latino males, preferably over 18, who can pass for 13-18. We are also looking for a few Caucasian males who can play in this age range.

If you’re interested, please contact April Xiong at [april.xiong@gmail.com](mailto:april.xiong@gmail.com).
