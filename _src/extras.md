Have you ever wanted to be in a movie? We’re looking for people with some time on their hands to help fill our scenes. For our most extensive, extra-heavy scene, we’re looking for young African-American and Latino males, preferably over 18, who can pass for 13-18. We are also looking for a few Caucasian males who can play in this age range. 

If you’re interested, please contact April TK at TK.

Check below, and check this page often to see when and where we’ll need people! You can also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/HappyBabyMovie"><cite>Happy Baby</cite> on Twitter</a> for complete extras updates.

The following scenes (times specified) will require extras:

- Scene 1 (Date, Time, and Place)
- Scene 2 (Date, Time, and Place)
- Etc. Etc. Etc.
