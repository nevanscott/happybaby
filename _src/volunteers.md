Have you ever wanted to work on a movie set? Do you have some time to spare? We’re looking for some hard-working individuals with can-do attitudes to help make things run as smoothly as possible on the <cite>Happy Baby</cite> set. Our shoot starts on May 8th, and while it would be great to get some people who could work during 22 shooting days (that’s about a month in real time), we understand that everyone has a different schedule and lives to lead. So if you’re interested in volunteering for even a day or two, please be in touch! We’re especially looking for people with cars, people who can lift things, and people who are friendly.

While we unfortunately can’t pay any of our volunteers, if you donate your time, you’ll receive a thank you credit in the movie, a thank you credit in real life, and free food for however many days you can help us out. Also, you will be working with an amazing group of people, and get to watch [this guy](http://stephenelliott.com/#about) in action, so if anything, it’s bound to be a good time. 

If you’re interested in volunteering, please contact Rebecca Rubenstein at [rubenstein@therumpus.net](mailto:rubenstein@therumpus.net).
