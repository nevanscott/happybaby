	<h1>Donations</h1>
	<p>A movie, so often, is a labor of love. It’s not always obvious, but movies are made by tons of people—communities of hard-working, committed individuals who really believe in the project, in what it stands for and what the final outcome will be. We’re making <cite>Happy Baby</cite> with this sort of mentality in mind. We want to make something from our hearts, and your hearts, too. When we launched our Kickstarter campaign, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re convinced we can make a quality compelling feature, outside of the system, for less than what feature movies are believed to cost. We’re also convinced, because of running <a href="http://therumpus.net">The Rumpus</a>, and making the movie <a href="http://therumpus.net/cherry/trailer/">About Cherry</a>, that there are new and interesting ways to tell stories that don’t require all the traditional methods. We think we can avoid the frustrations of institutional censorship and financing. And we can open ourselves to making a movie that invites, and takes advantage of, all the new avenues and advances in digital photography, distribution, and community and the result will be a better artistic creation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Kickstarter was only the beginning. We’re still interested in getting people involved, and we still need so many things in order to make <cite>Happy Baby</cite> a reality. That’s why we’re asking for donations and volunteers. If you’d like to donate some food (so we can feed our cast and crew), or some space (we’re still looking for a few locations to shoot in), scroll down to read about the different things we’re looking for. If you’re interested in volunteering your time on set, <a href="/volunteers/">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Not only will you receive a thank you credit at the end of the movie, you will forever be in our hearts.</p>

<p>For all inquiries, or to express interest in donating or volunteering, please contact Rebecca Rubenstein at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#117;&#098;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#112;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">&#114;&#117;&#098;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#112;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;</a>. </p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>Here are a few ways you can help feed our cast and crew:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Cook meals:</h3>

    <p>We’re looking for people who would be up to the task of cooking meals for about 30 people, give or take. We’re not necessarily looking for someone who would do this full-time (although we’d love you if you could), but even one donated, homecooked meal would make a huge difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Donate money:</h3>

    <p>If you can’t bring a meal to set, but would still like to help out in this capacity, we’re taking monetary donations so we can feed everyone and support local eateries. If you’d like to sponsor a meal, you can do it for $400, but we’d be happy with anything you’d be willing to give.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Donate food from your own restaurant, café, or food truck:</h3>

    <p>If you’re reading this, and you either work in or own an eating establishment (stationary or mobile), and you’d like to help a low-budget indie feature out, we’d love to talk to you. <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#117;&#098;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#112;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">Please contact us!</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll also have a craft services table on set, so if you’re thinking, Man, I want to help, but all I can do is make cookies, we’ll take whatever you want to drop off! Food made with love is always food worth having.</p>

<p>Interested in donating? <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#117;&#098;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#112;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">Hit us up.</a> (We are also looking for a few <a href="/volunteers/">hard-working volunteers</a> to help man the craft services table, make coffee runs, and do all sorts of food-related stuff.)</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>We’re almost there, but we’re still looking for a few places to shoot. If you have access to or own any of the following spaces, and would be interested in letting us use them, please <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#117;&#098;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#112;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">let us know</a>:</p>
